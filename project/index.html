        <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
        <div class="text">
          <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer
            systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human
            intelligence. These systems learn from data, adapt to new
            information, and make decisions based on patterns and algorithms. AI
            encompasses various techniques, including machine learning, natural
            language processing, and computer vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            In practical terms, AI powers virtual assistants, recommendation
            algorithms, and self-driving cars. It enables chatbots to understand
            and respond to user queries, personalizes content on websites, and
            even diagnoses medical conditions. As AI continues to evolve, its
            impact on society grows, influencing industries such as healthcare,
            finance, and entertainment.

            >
            AI plays a pivotal role in automating repetitive tasks, thereby
            increasing efficiency across various domains. From manufacturing to
            customer service, AI-powered systems can handle routine processes,
            freeing up human resources for more strategic and creative
            endeavors. For example, chatbots handle customer inquiries, machine
            learning algorithms optimize supply chains, and AI-driven robots
            assist in assembly lines. By streamlining operations, AI contributes
            to productivity gains and cost savings.

            <span class="bold-text">Solving Complex Problems:&nbsp;</span>
            AI excels at processing vast amounts of data and identifying
            patterns that humans might miss. In fields like healthcare, AI aids
            in diagnosing diseases, predicting outbreaks, and personalizing
            treatment plans. It also powers recommendation engines in
            e-commerce, suggesting products based on user preferences.
            Additionally, AI enables breakthroughs in scientific research, such
            as drug discovery and climate modeling. Its ability to tackle
            complex problems accelerates progress across disciplines, making it
            indispensable for our future.
