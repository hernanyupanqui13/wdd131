            <p>
              My name is Hernan Yupanqui, and I am from Lima, Peru. I recently
              returned from a mission, so I am starting to catch up with the
              courses. My major is Software Development, and I don't have an
              emphasis.
            </p>
            <p>
              About my interests, I love technology! That's part of the reason
              why I decided to study more software development. But another
              thing I really love is music. In my family there are some
              musicians, and I love to listen, practice, create and play music.
              That's my favorite activity I like to do with my brother and
              sister. In my family we are five humans and one dog. I enjoy
              passing time with them.

        <h2>My Software Development Passion</h2>
        <div class="card-content">
          <div class="card-content-text">
            <p>
              My passion for Software development started when I made my first
              line of code that worked many years ago. Just small pieces of code
              created something different and new on the screen, and for me that
              was fantastic. I was working with the computer in a totally
              different way. I became an enthusiast about software, code, and
              computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a software enthusiast, I find immense joy in crafting elegant
              solutions to real-world problems. The blend of creativity,
              problem-solving, and continuous learning keeps me engaged. Whether
              it's designing algorithms, collaborating with teams, or witnessing
              the impact of my code, every aspect fuels my passion. Software
              development is not just a career; it's an exciting journey of
              growth and impact.
